My 2023 side project

an app that acts as a third party facilitator for parents to raise children. We use virtual money I.e. gems or some other resources that are rewarded upon completion of tasks which they can switch for USD to spend. There can also be incentives to save gems and practice investment by giving interests, etc. this not only gameifys children earning chores money, but also makes the child develop many skills that are directly applicable when they make the jump into independence.

Problem Im trying to solve: Many kids donâ€™t learn good financial skills. This is especially true for kids who are born in economically poor households. Their parents are never taught the importance of financial education and possibly too busy to even worry about financial education.
